Author: Joel von Treifeldt

## Video Demo:  https://...

## TODO
- add POI with notes (e.g. a restaurant or forest we'd like to visit)
- add place re-ordering
- responsive design - mobile!

## Tech / resources used

- Python/Flask, for the backend
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, for the frontend
- SQLite, for the database
- Jinja, for templating
- Open Street Maps
- Leaflet.js, to get Open Street Maps happening
- Leaflet.draw, to enable drawing shapes on the map
- Nominatim, for searching for coordinates using place names
- uv, for environment management
- git, for version control
- Netlify, for deploying the site
- Claude AI, for learning

## Description

Mapsing is a simple project that uses Open Street Maps (via Leaflet.js) to create an interactive website for mapping purposes, optionally as a travel itinerary. Mapsing mostly takes place on one page. The basic functionality is based on places and shapes.

### Places

Places are major locations or destinations (usually cities). Places can be points only (no linestrings or polygons). 

By default, several shapes are seeded into the database by `init_db()`. The `places` SQLite table is the parent table to `shapes`. 

Places can be added with a simple form, which uses Nominatim to geocode, i.e. search coordinates by place name.

### Shapes

Shapes are like sub-places. They are points of interest, or routes between places, etc. They can be points, lines, or polygons. 

Similarly to places, several shapes are seeded into the database by `init_db()`. The `shapes` table in the database is the child/foreign-key table to the `places` table. 

The user can draw shapes into the map using Leaflet.draw.

## How To

Ensure you have sqlite3 installed. Create the `maps.db` file:
```bash
sqlite3 maps.db
```

And ensure you have `uv` installed! Now initialise your database:

```bash
# Create tables and seed data
uv run python db.py        

# When you need fresh start
uv run python db_reset.py  
```
